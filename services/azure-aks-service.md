# ☸️ Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Practical guide for understanding Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), why companies use it, and when to choose it for container orchestration, scalable application hosting, and cloud-native platform operations.


## 1️⃣ What It Is

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Microsoft Azure’s fully managed Kubernetes platform used to deploy, manage, scale, and operate containerized applications.

AKS reduces the complexity of running Kubernetes by allowing Azure to manage the control plane while customers manage workloads, node pools, networking, security, and application deployments.

It is commonly used for:

- Web applications  
- APIs  
- Microservices platforms  
- Internal enterprise tools  
- CI/CD hosted workloads  
- Container modernization projects  
- Hybrid cloud workloads  
- Dev/Test environments  

AKS combines Kubernetes power with Azure-native integrations.



## 2️⃣ Why Companies Use It

Organizations choose AKS because it provides:

- Managed Kubernetes control plane  
- Horizontal application scaling  
- Self-healing workloads  
- Rolling upgrades and deployments  
- Azure AD / RBAC integrations  
- Built-in networking options  
- Load balancer support  
- Private cluster capabilities  
- Monitoring integrations  
- Faster application deployments  
- Better resource efficiency than many VM workloads  

AKS helps companies modernize applications while reducing infrastructure overhead.


## 3️⃣ What Problem It Solves

Without AKS, companies often struggle with:

- Manual container orchestration  
- Downtime during deployments  
- Difficult scaling during traffic spikes  
- Inconsistent environments between dev and prod  
- Poor container lifecycle management  
- Limited self-healing capabilities  
- High VM sprawl for many small apps  
- Slow release cycles  
- Operational complexity of self-managed Kubernetes  

AKS centralizes these capabilities into a managed enterprise platform.



## 4️⃣ Day-to-Day Engineer Relevance

Engineers commonly use AKS for:

- Deploying containerized applications  
- Scaling workloads up or down  
- Troubleshooting pods and services  
- Performing rolling updates  
- Managing namespaces  
- Reviewing logs and metrics  
- Configuring ingress / load balancing  
- Securing workloads with identities and secrets  
- Supporting CI/CD release pipelines  
- Monitoring node health and cluster performance  

AKS is highly relevant for cloud engineers, DevOps engineers, SREs, platform engineers, and infrastructure teams.


## 5️⃣ When To Choose It Over a VM

Choose AKS instead of a VM when:

- You need multiple containers managed together  
- Applications must scale automatically  
- Zero-downtime deployments are important  
- You want self-healing workloads  
- Microservices architecture is in use  
- CI/CD pipelines deploy frequently  
- Teams need standardized container platforms  
- Resource efficiency matters  

Choose a VM when:

- Hosting one traditional monolithic application  
- Legacy software requires full OS access  
- Vendor software is not container compatible  
- Simpler workloads do not justify Kubernetes  
- Full server-level customization is required  

A VM hosts servers. AKS hosts modern application platforms.



## 6️⃣ Real-World Use Cases

- Public web applications behind load balancers  
- Internal APIs  
- Microservices platforms  
- Ecommerce application backends  
- Enterprise modernization projects  
- Development environments  
- Batch processing containers  
- Event-driven applications  
- SaaS multi-service platforms  
- Globally scalable web workloads
