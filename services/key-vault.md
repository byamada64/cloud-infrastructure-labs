# 🎫 Azure Key Vault

Practical guide for understanding Azure Key Vault, why companies use it, and when to choose it for secure credential and secret management.


## 1️⃣ What it is

Azure Key Vault is a fully managed cloud security service used to store and control access to:

- Passwords  
- API tokens  
- Certificates  
- Encryption keys  
- Connection strings  
- Sensitive application secrets  

Microsoft manages the underlying infrastructure, availability, and security platform while customers control access through Azure IAM / RBAC.



## 2️⃣ Why companies use it

Organizations choose Azure Key Vault because it provides:

- Centralized credential storage  
- Strong access control through RBAC  
- Secret rotation/versioning support  
- Reduced hardcoded passwords in code/scripts  
- Auditability for compliance teams  
- Secure integrations with Azure services  
- Encryption key management options  

It helps security and operations teams manage secrets professionally.



## 3️⃣ What problem it solves

Without Key Vault, companies often struggle with:

- Passwords stored in spreadsheets  
- Secrets hardcoded in scripts  
- Shared admin credentials  
- Poor credential rotation habits  
- No clear ownership of secrets  
- Difficulty proving compliance  
- Higher breach exposure risk  

Key Vault centralizes and secures these workflows.


## 4️⃣ Day-to-day engineer relevance

Engineers commonly use Key Vault for:

- Retrieving VM admin passwords securely  
- Storing SQL credentials  
- Managing API tokens  
- Supplying secrets to automation jobs  
- Managing certificate renewals  
- Supporting access reviews and audits  
- Securing production application configs  

It becomes part of normal cloud operations.


## 5️⃣ When to choose it over a VM

Choose Azure Key Vault instead of storing secrets on a VM when:

- You need centralized secret management  
- Multiple apps or teams need controlled access  
- You want audit logs of secret usage  
- You need credential rotation workflows  
- You want to remove passwords from servers  
- Compliance requires stronger controls  

Use a VM when hosting applications or services—not for storing credentials.


## 6️⃣ Real-world use cases

- VM local admin password storage  
- SQL database admin credentials  
- ServiceNow API tokens  
- Terraform / CI-CD pipeline secrets  
- TLS certificate management  
- Encryption keys for storage workloads  
- Break-glass administrator credentials  
- Shared enterprise app secrets
