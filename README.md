# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Engineering | AWS, Azure, CI/CD

Hands-on cloud infrastructure and platform engineering builds across AWS, Azure, and CI/CD tooling.

This repository demonstrates real-world provisioning, automation, and operational validation using repeatable deployment patterns rather than UI-driven workflows.

## 📌 Lab Scope

These builds focus on core deployment patterns and operational workflows rather than screenshots, since cloud interfaces change frequently while engineering principles remain consistent.

Structured headings are used as a repeatable framework to guide build, validation, and cleanup phases.


## 📖 About This Repo

This repository is organized into two complementary areas:

- **Deployments** → Hands-on builds showing how infrastructure is provisioned, configured, validated, and cleaned up  
- **Services** → Reference guides explaining service capabilities, tradeoffs, and when to use one solution over another  

The goal is to demonstrate both **execution (hands-on engineering)** and **decision-making (architecture awareness)** across cloud platforms.

Designed for engineers, recruiters, and hiring managers evaluating real-world cloud and automation experience.
