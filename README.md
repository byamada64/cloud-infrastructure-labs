# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Builds | AWS, Azure & CI/CD

Hands-on cloud infrastructure builds, automation workflows, architecture references, and deployment guides across AWS, Azure, and CI/CD platforms.

## 📌 Lab Scope Note

These guides prioritize build concepts and deployment flow over screenshots, since cloud interfaces evolve frequently while core engineering principles and deployment patterns remain consistent.

Structured headings are intentionally used to serve as a follow-along framework, helping readers navigate each phase of a build while adapting steps to their own environment.


## 📖 About This Repo

This repository contains two types of practical cloud engineering content:

- **Deployments** → Step-by-step build notes showing how resources were provisioned, configured, validated, and cleaned up.
- **Services** → Quick-reference guides explaining what cloud services do, why companies use them, and when to choose them.

Designed for engineers, recruiters, and hiring managers who want real-world examples of both execution and platform understanding.


## 🗂️ Repository Layout

- [`aws/`](./aws/) → AWS builds organized by compute, network, security, containers, and app platforms
- [`azure/`](./azure/) → Azure builds organized by compute, network, security, containers, and app platforms
- [`ci-cd/`](./ci-cd/) → Automation content including Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform
- [`services/`](./services/) → Service explainers organized by AWS, Azure, and CI/CD tooling
